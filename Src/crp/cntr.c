//this file contains initializing, control and crypto procedures for JackPair
//unsigned char testcrp(void) provide self-test of crypto engine, compares with test vector, returns 1 is OK, 0-failure
//short setrand(int res) accept ADC result and calls untill returns 1 (RNG ready flag) 
//void setkey(unsigned int pin) accept u32 pin-code and calls on the start of session for preparing fresh keypair
//void getrand(unsigned char* m, short len) generate len PRNG bytes to m
//unsigned char ike_ber(unsigned char* m, signed char* logout) in IKE mode write to logout text log of data statistic in m
//this procedure returns 1 if we haven't their key otherwise returns 0
//void work_ber(unsigned char* m, signed char* logout) in WORK mode optonally write to logout text log of data statistic in m

//GENERAL LOGIK:

//On IKE stage (work=0) TX:
//unsigned char txkey(unsigned char* m) calls for generating trasmitted data, returns flag of control packet  
//void make_pkt(unsigned char* m) calls followed for insert control blocks or whitening transmitted data
//void Modulate(unsigned char* data, short* frame) calls followed for modulate data to PCM frame of baseband

//On IKE stage (work=0) RX:
//short Demodulate( short* frame, unsigned char* data, signed char* fout) calls for demodulate recorded PCM frame to data and bit's metrics
//this procedure returns value for fine adjusting of recording samle rate 
//short check_pkt(unsigned char* m) calls followed for check block is a control or de-witening data
//this procedure returns flag of control or data packet was received
//unsigned char rxkey(unsigned char* m, unsigned char* sb) calls followed to process received data
//this procedure accumulate bit's mectrics and check crc of hard decission bits of their key
//if key was completely received provide DH and compute encrypting and decrypting symmetric keys
//returns mode flag (0- for still IKE and 1 for set work mode)

//On WORK stage (work=1) TX:
//unsigned char melpe_a(unsigned char* bits, short* inbuf) calls for encode speech frame to data, returns VAD flag (1-voice)
//void make_pkt(unsigned char* m) calls followed for insert control blocks on speech pauses or encrypt voice data
//void Modulate(unsigned char* data, short* frame) calls followed for modulate data to PCM frame of baseband

//On WORK stage (work=1) RX:
//short Demodulate( short* frame, unsigned char* data, 0) calls for demodulate recorded PCM frame to data
//this procedure returns value for fine adjusting of recording samle rate 
//short check_pkt(unsigned char* m) calls followed for check block is a control or decrypt voice data
//melpe_s(outbuf, bits) calls followed for voice data decode it to speech frame
//for control next speech frame filled by silency.

//-------------Control packet format----------------------------
//control packet carry information about 24-bits counter and has special format for possible diference from arbitrary data
//control packet  contain 3 bytes of header, 3 bytes of hight counter value and 3 bytes is low counter value
//header is goley23/12 encoded 12 first bits of crc32 of 3 bytes of counter. Bit 23 is always 0 for detect channel inversion
//hight counter value is golay23/12 encoded 12MSB of counter and xoring with crc32 of header with bit 23 is 1
//low counter value is golay23/12 encoded 12LSB of counter and xoring with crc32 of header with bit 23 is 0
//-------------Control packet detecting-------------------------
//for detecting of received packet is a control checks bit 23 of header and all bit inverted if need
//then bit 23 of header sets as 1, computes crc32 of header and xor with 3 bytes hight counter value
//resulted value decoded with golay23/12 to 12MSB of expected counter
//then bit 23 of header sets as 1, computes crc32 of headers and xor with 3 bytes low counter value
//resulted value decoded with golay23/12 to 12 LSB of expected counter
//then composed 24 bits counter and computed crc32 of 3 bytes of counter,
//12 first bits of this crc compared with golay 23/12 decoded header value
//if all 12 bits are equal the packet decissed as a control otherwise - as a data (voice in work mode or ked in IKE mode)
//for control packets we can synchrinize our counter with value transmitted in a control packet
//if delta is less then 0 (back) our counter is freezed (not incremented). If delta is +1 our counter is set to new value forverd
//if delta is more then 1 this delta is saved and compared with delta of next control. If it is the same our counter corrected to new arbitrary value forward.
//This is for preventing fake big correction forvard with imossibility to fast correction back 
//because our conter is strongly one-way and can't be set to arbitrary value back, only freezing current value and wait for TX.
